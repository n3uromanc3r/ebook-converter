This software comes with absolutely NO WARRANTY!  
You are free to use and modify it as you see fit, but you must abide by the
license!

It is my first open source release, so it may not be the best software!
It works, but there may be bugs!

Dependencies:
This is merely a GUI for the commandline utility 'ebook-convert', that is
provided with the Calibre eBook Management software (found in most distro's repos).
So you'll need that installed for a start!

Also, this version relies on notify-send to relay a message upon successful conversion.
Later version will need some fallback for systems without this installed I'm sure.

How to use:

Simply execute the provided ebook-converter.py python file and you're away.
You may want to make the file executable.
